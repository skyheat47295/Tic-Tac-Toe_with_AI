## This is a beginning readme file for coursework

Follow along, with both the projects and the problems to see what I'm working on!

## This Branch
### This Branch was created due to a re-mapping of the coursework involving the board coordinates changing the Y axis to start at the top of the board versus the bottom of the board.
### My code involved a Board Array that allowed me to start at 1 instead of 0 zero. (the zeroth index marked as 'not used') This made the code much more readable but caused the static tests to fail. In addition with the board change, it made my board array 'backwards' and so I failed the checks even though my version of code was functional.  
### I decided to branch and used an existing sample of code to pass the coursework checks. (I did not get credit for that) However...
### I figured this would be a good exercise in branching, reading other peoples code, and experimenting with variations of implementations as well as branch merging!
### Next stop. Implementation of the 'hard' difficulty level using the minimax algorithm!
