## This is a beginning readme file for coursework

Follow along, with both the projects and the problems to see what I'm working on!

## Current Project
## This Branch
### This Branch was created due to a re-mapping of the coursework involving the board coordinates to be re-mapped using the Y coordinate starting at the top of the board versus the bottom of the board.
### The original code would not pass the testing parameters, so I branched and used an existing sample of code to pass
### the coursework checks. (I did not get credit for that) However...
### I figured this would be a good exercise in branching, reading other peoples code, and experimenting with variations
### implementations as well as branch merging.
